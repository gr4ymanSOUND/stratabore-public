        <img class="center-pic" src="img/IMG_2361.jpg"  alt="Picture of Tommy">
        <p>Tommy Lawrence started StrataBore in [year] after [more than 15 years] of experience in the industry. During that time, he worked in the field, in the lab, and in the office managing multiple crews and teams. As he gained knowledge and insight into the business side of things, he saw opportunities to make improvements throughout the business as a whole. He put that into action by starting his own business.</p>
        <p>Thanks to his experience and expertise, [12+?] years after making that jump StrataBore is operating [how many?] rigs reaching across the entire DFW metroplex area and beyond. With good weather and a full crew, we can drill up to [# of jobs per week or maybe average feet per day? something like that].</p>
